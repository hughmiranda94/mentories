# Working with classes

In this excercise you will implement two classes: AlbumView and AlbumService. AlbumService will import information from [this service](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums?userId=1) & AlbumView will draw a list of pictures pulled from the AlbumService. Also, the Albumview should display its list in two view modes: list or tiles.

This implementation will be stored under ```src/album-view.js``` and ```src/album-service.js```.

This excercise is considered solved when you complet all scenarios listed in ```test/excercise-2.spec.js```.
